## Prompt Engineering 🧠

This project utilizes advanced prompt engineering techniques to improve the quality and relevance of the generated cover letters. The `prompts/` folder contains three main prompts, each designed for a specific task in the cover letter generation process:

1. Resume Formatting Prompt:
   - Purpose: Converts various resume formats into a structured markdown format.
   - Key Features:
     * Uses markdown headers to organize sections (e.g., Experience, Education, Skills)
     * Formats contact information, experience, and education consistently
     * Preserves all original information while improving readability

2. Job Description Analysis Prompt:
   - Purpose: Extracts key information from the job description.
   - Key Features:
     * Identifies job title, company name, and summarizes main responsibilities
     * Extracts up to 5 required and 5 preferred skills/qualifications
     * Analyzes company vibe and culture based on the job description language

3. Cover Letter Generation Prompt:
   - Purpose: Creates a tailored cover letter based on the resume and job description analysis.
   - Key Features:
     * Adjusts tone based on a 1-5 scale (very formal to casual)
     * Structures the letter with an opening, skills alignment paragraphs, and closing
     * Emphasizes how the candidate's skills match the job requirements
     * Incorporates the company's vibe into the letter's style

These prompts work together to:
- Extract relevant information from your resume
- Analyze the job description for key requirements and company culture
- Structure the cover letter in a professional format
- Tailor the content to highlight your qualifications for the specific job

By using well-designed prompts, the system generates focused and effective cover letters. Users can modify these prompts in the `prompts/` folder to fine-tune the output according to their preferences or specific industry requirements.
